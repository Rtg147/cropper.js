# cropper.js
A simple bootstrap modal cropper

Start by adding the index.html elements to your page.

Then use the cropToBase64 in the event you'd like to use (in this case the save changes button will be the best solution),change the picture by your own and thats it.You get a base64 image that you can sen by POST and convert to an image in your server.

Last but not least : The project is far from beeing perfect feel free to enhace.Lots of feature could be added like giving to JSON cropping coordinates.
